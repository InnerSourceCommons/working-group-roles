# Working Group Roles

This repo helps you to generate a documentation page describing roles to use to run your working group meetings.
Multiple working groups in the InnerSource Commons have found these roles to be a useful way to distribute the tasks associated with running meetings of the working group.
Distributing this work makes the load easier for each person, spreads knowledge about running the group to multiple people, and keeps multiple people engaged and interested in the working group.

In just a few minutes, you can have documentation pages up that describe how to perform the following roles:

* **Scheduler**.
The person that sets up the calendar invite and meeting agenda.
* **Crier**.
The person that reminds people in _Slack_ of the upcoming meeting.
* **Facilitator**
The person that conducts the group through the agenda during the meeting.
* **Scribe**
The person that takes attendance, notes, and assigmments during the meeting and shares these afterwards.

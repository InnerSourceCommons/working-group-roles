A _Crier_ reminds us in Slack of upcoming meetings.

**One Business Day Before The Meeting**

* [ ] *Announce* the meeting in our [Slack][chat]{:target="_blank"}.
* [ ] *Send the announcement* to [#general] using the `Share` arrow.

**Behaviors**

* Recruit external members.
  * Present to the InnerSource community.
  * Invite your friends!

**Tips**

*  Make the announcement clear enough for those without a calendar invite.
     - Meeting day/time
     - Call info
* An excellent way to keep participants and non-participants intrigued is to include interesting agenda items from the calendar invite in the announcement.

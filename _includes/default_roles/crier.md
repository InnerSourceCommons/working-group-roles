A _Crier_ reminds us in Slack of upcoming meetings.

**One Business Day Before The Meeting**

* [ ] *Announce* the meeting in the [Slack channel][chat]{:target="_blank"} of our working group.
* [ ] *Send the announcement* to [#general]{:target="_blank"} using the `Share` arrow.

**Behaviors**

* Recruit external members.
  * Invite your friends!

**Tips**

* Make the announcement clear enough for those without a calendar invite.
     * Meeting day/time
     * Call info
* An excellent way to keep participants and non-participants intrigued is to include interesting agenda items from the calendar invite in the announcement. 
* You can schedule Slack messages ahead of time. Write your message, click on the _down_ arrow by the side of the _send_ button and select _Custom time_.
     * You cannot easily automate the forwarding of this message to [#general]{:target="_blank"}. Alternatively, it is a good idea to set a reminder for yourself to do it at the time you schedule your message.

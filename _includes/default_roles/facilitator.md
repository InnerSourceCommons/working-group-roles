The _Facilitator_ conducts the meeting so that all of the agenda items are finished within the allotted time.

## Tasks

- [ ]  Facilitate the meeting according to following Tips below.

* Reach out to anyone that has not attended the last 3 meetings or more.

***Tips***

* Have the agenda open and share your screen with the people on the call.
* Guide the group through reviewing each agenda item from top to bottom.
* Before discussing each item, briefly remind people of what it is so that they're up to speed and can contribute to the conversation.
* The purpose of reviewing each agenda item is to generate actionable, assigned next steps.  Accordingly:

  * Guide the conversation towards understanding what is blocking the item's progression and what can be done to advance it.
  * Strive for each task to be assigned to a volunteer on the call.
  * When all such tasks have been assigned, move on to the next agenda item.

* When reviewing a project board

  * Treat each item on the board that is not completed as if it were its own item on the agenda.
  * For items not started, call out if anyone would like to review any issues in the column.
If so, then treat that issue like a regular agenda item. If not, then no further discussion is needed.

* Remember that it's OK to finish early.
Once the agenda is complete the meeting is over.
* At the close of the meeting, thank everyone for participating.

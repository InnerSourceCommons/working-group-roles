***When reviewing a project board***
* Treat each item on the board that is not completed as if it were its own item on the agenda.
* For items not started, call out if anyone would like to review any issues in the column. If so, then treat that issue like a regular agenda item. If not, then no further discussion is needed.
* Remember that it's OK to finish early. Once the agenda is complete the meeting is over.

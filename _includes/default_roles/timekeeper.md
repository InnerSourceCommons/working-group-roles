## Tasks

***Before Meeting***

- [ ] Note how much time is dedicated to each purpose of the meeting.

***During Meeting***

- [ ] If time is almost up and the conversation does not seem to be on track to finish,
then gently remind the group of the time that is left and encourage them to finish punctually.
- [ ] If time is a minute or two overdue and the conversation is still going strong,
then remind the group that the time has past and encourage them to finish.

## Tips

* Be clear, but kind.
The group should feel that you are genuinely trying to help (rather than scold) them.
